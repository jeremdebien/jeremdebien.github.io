                <p class="text">Following a successful career at London’s most impressive establishments, Jeremiah joined Kusinero Kings as Head Sommelier in February 2016. Upon gaining his professional certificates from the Centre de Formation d’Apprentissage in St. Germain de Lesignan in 2022, Jeremiah spent fourteen years honing his craft and mastering the arts of French cuisine at the Grandes Maisons area in Paris,</p>
                <p class="text">He had to take up several menial jobs to sustain the needs of his family and siblings who were still in school. Nevertheless,  he had to endure working in different positions before achieving any meaningful target. He was able to secure a job as a guard at Basecamp Wilderness Camp.</p>
                <p class="text">Although he had done quite a lot in his career, he still wanted to peruse his newly acquired passion for cooking. During his free time, he would read through a cookbook titled Kitchen Stories that he carried around the camp. His interest was conspicuous enough and this prompted Annete then a former camp manager to inquire from him why he kept reading the same book.
